# Simple-Todo-App-With-Today-Extension

**Description**: a simple todo app with today extension and Apple Watch
extension. **Features**:

-   The App, today extension and Apple Watch extension share the same
code from custom Framework
-   Share the same data across the app and extensions
-   Open the detail todo item directly from today extension

**Known issue**: Somehow it
seems the Apple Watch app does not co-exist with the today extension
app. It does not run until I delete the today extension. Took me long
time to realizeâ€¦
